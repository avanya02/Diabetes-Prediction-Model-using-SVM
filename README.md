# Diabetes-Prediction-Model-using-SVM
# Overview
This project aims to predict the likelihood of an individual being diabetic based on key health factors using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model. The model leverages features such as age, BMI, glucose levels, and other relevant indicators to make accurate predictions, aiding in early detection and management of diabetes.

# Features
SVM Model: Utilizes Support Vector Machine for classification.
Key Health Indicators: Age, BMI, glucose levels, etc.
Early Detection: Aims to identify potential diabetes cases early for better management.

## Dataset
The model is trained on a small to medium-sized dataset, which includes data points related to health metrics that are influential in diagnosing diabetes.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/avanya02/diabetes-prediction.git
cd diabetes-prediction
2. Install required libraries: pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the jupyter notebook: jupyter notebook Diabetes_Prediction.ipynb
