# Diabetes-Prediction-Model-using-SVM
This project develops a predictive model using Support Vector Machine (SVM) to estimate an individual's likelihood of having diabetes based on key health factors like age, BMI, and glucose levels. The model is trained on a small to medium-sized dataset, aiming for efficient early detection of diabetes.
